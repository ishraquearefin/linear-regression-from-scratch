# Linear Regression from Scratch with NumPy

This repository contains a simple implementation of linear regression using gradient descent, built from scratch using only NumPy and Matplotlib. It demonstrates the basic principles of machine learning model training, including cost computation, gradient calculation, and optimization via gradient descent.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Manual cost function implementation
- Gradient calculation for weight (`w`) and bias (`b`)
- Gradient descent optimization loop
- Visualization of cost convergence over iterations
- Prediction using the learned model

## ðŸ“ˆ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
